Natural forwarding/routing/addressing/connection. Plugin-and-use wireless networking.
In traditional mobile networks like cellular networks, the mobility is a big problem considering the mobile node are moving and we need to assign different connections and network addresses to that node to make consistent connections and data communications.
WiFi handover is a big problem in WLAN since connections and addresses all need to be setup when doing handover.

How do a router or a switch do table entry searching? How can the search algorithm scale?

Today's network IP addressing system is high inefficient considering the address space efficiency and the potential entries in a network router. When considering the routing algorithm with this addressing system, it is rather confused and complex.

In traditional routing, for each router or switch, it need to figure out on which port it should forward a specific packet or frame, to build such a table is effort-consuming and highly depend on the scale of the network which will impact the scalability of the network. How can we change this situation?

In addition to the need to accommodate scalable routing and addressing, some of the other wish list items for IPv6 were:
	support for real-time services
	security support
	autoconfiguration (i.e., the ability of hosts to automatically configure themselves with such information as their own IP address and domain name)
	enhanced routing functionality, including support for mobile hosts.

Why wireless networks need to do association which is emulating the traditional wired networks?

In enterprise WLAN, why we only use one AP to do service for one client? When the frame is lost and need to be retransmitted, we should not stick to that AP anymore, we could try to send the frame using another adjscent AP.

In an router in the Internet, when we can foresee that the queue is to be full and the incoming packets are going to be dropped, can we share some packets with the adjscent routers so that we can hold much more incoming packets?

Wireless communication is basically a mobile sensing technique. The problem is that the sensing is not identical, this sensing is not associated with device-wide distinction information, which is a public media information.

===========*****===========
One important thing to notice is that although the spanning tree algorithm is able to reconfigure the spanning tree whenever a bridge fails, it is not able to forward frames over alternative paths for the sake of routing around a congested bridge.

1. What is different between the traditional networks and networks with nodes having multi-modal sensing capability?
From different network layers' perspective (TCP/IP):
1) Physical layer especially for wireless PHY like WiFi/Bluetooth/Zigbee/Wimax/5G
In traditional wireless PHY, the dynamics of the physical environment is the enemy to the communication technology and many wireless communication technologies are designed make the dynamics transparent to coding/decoding, multiple access, modulation, etc.
Now we have sensors who can sense detailed dynamics of the environment, and there are many papers trying to explore the sensing ability of different sensors like motion sensors, location sensors and even wireless characteristics like CSI. What I want to do go beyond is how to use this results from sensing to assist the PHY design.
2) Link layer
3) Internet layer
4) Transport layer
5) Application layer
